# Lab 9 Report

In this lab, we placed the robot in an environment and had it spin around to take measurements of its distance to the nearest obstacle. We then used this data to produce a map of the environment.

## Lab Tasks

### Small and Accurate Turns

First, we need to program the robot to do fourteen turns of 25 degrees each accurately. We use our Lab 6 orientation control to accomplish this.

### Measure Distances

Get the data

### Merge and Plot Readings

Transform data

### Convert to Line-Based Map

Draw some lines hooray
